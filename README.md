Holidays are not counted since
To calculate for regular income, it needs hourly rate and daily work hours,
To calculate for daily work hours, we need late and undertime hours.

But for holidays, there are no late and undertime hours means we put 0 there.
If we put that as 0, then every holidays we give them 8 hours.
But how do we differentiate people who worked on holidays and those who didn't?
We cant.
