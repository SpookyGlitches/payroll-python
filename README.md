The outputs of the test case are wrong and the specification lacked details on where to put the holiday working hours.

So what I did was to treat the holidays as a regular working day but with a
different pay or we can also call it as a regular working holiday.

So daily work hours now contains the regular working hours + holiday working hours

And the employee can also choose to work at a holiday and overtime.
So if holiday and overtime, basic hourly rate \* 1.1 \* 1.1
